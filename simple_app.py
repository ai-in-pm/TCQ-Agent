    ## Paper: Task-Circuit Quantization: Leveraging Knowledge Localization and Interpretability for Compression
    
    **Authors**: Hanqi Xiao, Yi-Lin Sung, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal (UNC Chapel Hill)
    
    ### Abstract
    
    Post-training quantization (PTQ) reduces a model's memory footprint by mapping full precision weights into low bit weights without costly retraining, but can degrade its downstream performance especially in low 2- to 3-bit settings. We develop a new mixed-precision PTQ approach, Task-Circuit Quantization (TACQ), that draws parallels to automated circuit discovery, directly conditioning the quantization process on specific weight circuits â€“ which we define as sets of weights associated with downstream task performance. These weights are kept as 16-bit weights, while others are quantized, maintaining performance while only adding a marginal memory cost.
    
    ### Key Findings
    
    1. **Not All Weights Are Equal**: The paper demonstrates that not all weights in a large language model (LLM) are equally important for a given task. Some weights form "circuits" that are critical for specific tasks.
    
    2. **Saliency Metric**: TCQ uses a novel saliency metric composed of two components:
       - **Quantization-aware Localization (QAL)**: Estimates how quantization will affect each weight and its impact on model performance
       - **Magnitude-sharpened Gradient (MSG)**: Measures the general importance of each weight
    
    3. **Performance Improvements**: TCQ significantly outperforms existing quantization methods, especially in ultra-low bit settings (2-3 bits):
       - In 2-bit settings: Up to 21.9% improvement over the strongest baseline
       - In 3-bit settings: Preserves up to 96% of unquantized accuracy
    
    4. **Task-Specific Benefits**: Conditioning on task-specific data further improves performance compared to using general datasets.
    
    ### Methodology
    
    The TCQ process involves:
    
    1. **Weight Importance Calculation**: Calculate the saliency score for each weight using the formula: `TACQ(Wij) = |Wij| Â· âˆ‚L/âˆ‚Wij Â· |Q(Wij) - Wij|`
    
    2. **Outlier Identification**: Identify the top p% (typically 0.35%) of weights with the highest saliency scores
    
    3. **Mixed-Precision Quantization**: Preserve the outlier weights in 16-bit precision while quantizing the remaining weights to the target bit-width (2-3 bits)
    
    ### Results
    
    TCQ shows major improvements over existing approaches, especially in ultra-low bit settings (2-3 bits):
    
    - In 2-bit settings: 16% improvement on GSM8k, 14.1% on MMLU, and 21.9% on Spider over SliM-LLM
    - In 3-bit settings: Preserves approximately 91%, 96%, and 89% of unquantized accuracy on GSM8k, MMLU, and Spider
    
    ### Practical Applications
    
    TCQ has several practical applications:
    
    1. **Edge Deployment**: Enables deployment of large language models on resource-constrained devices
    2. **Reduced Memory Footprint**: Reduces the memory requirements for serving large language models
    3. **Task-Specific Optimization**: Allows models to be optimized for specific tasks
    4. **Privacy-Sensitive Applications**: Enables local processing of sensitive data without sending it to the cloud

    st.markdown("""
    ## Task-Circuit Quantization (TCQ) Explained
    
    TCQ is a novel mixed-precision post-training quantization approach that identifies and preserves critical weights in a neural network while quantizing less important ones to lower bit-widths.
    
    ### How TCQ Works
    
    1. **Saliency Metric**: TCQ uses a saliency metric composed of two components:
       - **Quantization-aware Localization (QAL)**: Estimates how quantization will affect each weight and its impact on model performance
       - **Magnitude-sharpened Gradient (MSG)**: Measures the general importance of each weight
    
    2. **Mathematical Formula**: The saliency metric is calculated as:
       `TACQ(Wij) = |Wij| Â· âˆ‚L/âˆ‚Wij Â· |Q(Wij) - Wij|`
       
       Where:
       - `|Wij|` is the magnitude of the weight
       - `âˆ‚L/âˆ‚Wij` is the gradient of the loss with respect to the weight
       - `|Q(Wij) - Wij|` is the expected change in the weight due to quantization
    
    3. **Outlier Identification**: TCQ identifies the top {outlier_percentage}% of weights with the highest saliency scores as "outliers"
    
    4. **Mixed-Precision Quantization**: TCQ preserves the outlier weights in 16-bit precision while quantizing the remaining weights to {bit_width}-bit
    
    ### Why TCQ Works Better Than Other Methods
    
    1. **Task-Specific Circuits**: TCQ identifies weights that form circuits critical for specific tasks
    
    2. **Quantization Effects**: TCQ explicitly considers how quantization will affect each weight
    
    3. **Global and Local Information**: TCQ uses both global gradient information and local weight magnitude
    
    4. **Minimal Memory Overhead**: By preserving only {outlier_percentage}% of weights in 16-bit precision, TCQ maintains model performance with minimal memory overhead
    
    ### Performance Improvements
    
    - In 2-bit settings: 16% improvement on GSM8k, 14.1% on MMLU, and 21.9% on Spider over SliM-LLM
    - In 3-bit settings: Preserves approximately 91%, 96%, and 89% of unquantized accuracy on GSM8k, MMLU, and Spider

        I'll demonstrate Task-Circuit Quantization with {bit_width}-bit precision while preserving {outlier_percentage}% of weights as outliers for the {task_type} task.
        
        ### Step 1: Calculate Saliency Scores
        
        First, I calculate the saliency score for each weight using the formula:
        `TACQ(Wij) = |Wij| Â· âˆ‚L/âˆ‚Wij Â· |Q(Wij) - Wij|`
        
        This combines:
        - The magnitude of the weight (`|Wij|`)
        - The gradient of the loss with respect to the weight (`âˆ‚L/âˆ‚Wij`)
        - The expected change in the weight due to quantization (`|Q(Wij) - Wij|`)
        
        ### Step 2: Identify Outliers
        
        Next, I identify the top {outlier_percentage}% of weights with the highest saliency scores as "outliers" to preserve in 16-bit precision.
        
        ### Step 3: Quantize Non-Outlier Weights
        
        I quantize the remaining weights to {bit_width}-bit precision using channel-wise quantization.
        
        ### Step 4: Evaluate Performance
        
        Finally, I evaluate the performance of the quantized model on the {task_type} task.
        
        ### Results
        
        For the {task_type} task at {bit_width}-bit quantization:
        
        - TCQ achieves significantly better performance than baseline methods
        - TCQ preserves the model's ability to perform the task effectively
        - Other methods like GPTQ, SqueezeLLM, and SPQR degrade to near-random performance
